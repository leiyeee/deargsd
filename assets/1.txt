Dear Dean Whiting,

This past Wednesday, October 28, you invited a small group of representatives from the undersigned to meet with you for one hour on Friday 30. This group comprised those both available on short notice to accommodate the time you designated and comfortable (at least relatively) with the power dynamics of a meeting with the administration. We met not to air our individual concerns but to voice the collective distress of 376 students and alumni across all eight MDes concentrations.

Before detailing our meeting and the commitments you made therein, an urgent matter: the Leave of Absence (LoA) deadline is on November 6, four days from this writing. This deadline requires that current students decide whether to (a) stay in their MDes concentrations for another term of distance learning or (b) take leave only to return next year to a completely different program. Amidst the unclear structure of the new MDes program and the anxiety of tomorrow’s election, we kindly ask that you extend the LoA deadline to November 15.

During our meeting, you noted that the opinions of the school’s senior faculty and administrators were given more weight in the restructuring process because these GSD members are “the ones who carry the school forward.” In fact, we, the students and alumni of the GSD, carry the school forward too, because we carry it out into the world. Our experiences at the GSD prepare us to engage through design with communities across the globe and, in doing so, participate in shaping their futures. Moreover, we are concerned that the school’s senior faculty do not reflect the diversity of the GSD’s faculty at large. We hope that future engagement efforts in the MDes restructuring process incorporate a more diverse group of perspectives, especially considering recent commitments made by the administration to dismantle racial and gendered hierarchies in the school.

To this end, we appreciate your verbal commitment to involve more voices moving forward. However, we believe that a truly inclusive process is one in which those affected by administrative decisions are allowed input into them—as specified by Harvard's own policies. It is not too late to create such a process here, but doing so will require a willingness on your part to reconsider aspects of the decisions that have already been finalized. We ask that you commit in no uncertain terms to a more transparent and inclusive process that incorporates varied perspectives, including those expressed in our original letter. We look forward to receiving from you a plan detailing a clear timeline and framework of how and when this inclusive future engagement will unfold.

In closing, we reiterate that we do not stand against change. We support reforming the MDes program, and we see room for its evolution. What we want is for the program to be reformed through a more transparent and inclusive process that incorporates the perspectives and concerns of a diverse group of MDes students, faculty, and alumni.

🗞️ The Harvard Crimson: “Graduate School of Design Faces Backlash After Restructuring Master of Design Studies Program.”↗


Tuesday, October 27, 2020
Dear Dean Whiting,

We are students and alumni from the existing Master in Design Studies (MDes) concentrations, which, as of this past week, have been dismantled by your administration and will soon no longer exist at the GSD. We write to express our profound disappointment regarding your decision to impose such drastic changes to the MDes program with so little transparency and consultation during the process. While we understand and agree with the need to revise and update our program, we believe that the restructured model that was presented to us on October 22, 2020 is deficient in key areas. We therefore urge you to resume the process of reforming our degree program, and to this time include our perspectives in your process.

The MDes program that we joined was timely: it met the needs of a quickly changing world. The degree offered us the opportunity to define new ways of designing that reached beyond the traditional categories of the profession (i.e. Landscape Architecture, Architecture, and Urban Planning). However, your recent changes have restructured the program under four new “domains” that in fact conform to those traditional categories. We believe this to be detrimental to the interdisciplinary nature of our concentrations, which enabled us to engage in rich debate, critical thinking, and original research during our time at the GSD.

The breadth of our concentrations meant that our Area Heads were professionals such as designers, artists, historians, curators, and more. Each year, our cohorts were chosen by our Area Heads because our diverse interests intersected with theirs, creating a dynamic and effective learning environment. The conversations that we shared with our cohorts were among the most valuable experiences we gained while at the GSD.

Our program may have lacked the centralized cohesion of the traditional design degrees offered by the Landscape, Architecture, and Planning departments, but this was one of our strengths. In many of your emails over the past year, you declared your commitment to ensuring that the GSD will adequately adapt in order to address the most urgent issues of our day: from climate change and mass migrations to the fight for racial justice. But the necessary change in order for designers to be able to adequately address these contemporary needs requires rupture and radical experimentation outside of the traditional disciplines.

Sometimes centralized cohesion means being constricted by the boundaries of traditional categories, or it means a return to the status quo. We urge you to consider this. In this current moment in time, the traditional categories of the design profession are simply not enough.

The decision to restructure the Master in Design Studies program through four new “domains” has neutralized what was once an experimental degree that pushed the boundaries of traditional design pedagogies. What you have defined as a “Master in Design Studies of Ecologies” is what you already find included in a Master in Landscape Architecture (MLA). What you have defined as a “Master in Design Studies of Publics” is already part of the Master in Urban Planning (MUP). Finally, what you have defined as a “Master in Design Studies of Narratives” and a “Master in Design Studies of Mediums” reads exactly like what you would find in either an undergraduate or graduate course on Architecture. The decision to silo the Master in Design Studies program into these new “domains” renders our degree redundant.

If we had wanted to join MLA, MArch, and MUP degrees, we likely would have spent more time trying to pursue those paths. And yet, each of us chose to join MDes.  

Besides this, the four new “domains” have been defined in generic and ambiguous ways. “Ecology” is already a scientific field of study that students can pursue at Harvard outside of the GSD. “Publics,” described as “the study of human groups and their interactions,” is already what students could pursue at Harvard in the fields of Anthropology and Sociology. And finally, “Mediums” and “Narratives” are terms that lack such specificity that they could be applied to most, if not all, design processes.

The restructuring of the MDes program has other substantial consequences. The elimination of the Technology, Risk & Resilience, and Energy & Environment concentrations has endangered students’ eligibility to apply for a three-year STEM OPT extension. The choice to remove the option for an MDes Thesis discards what many of us believe to be the capstone of our post-professional studies and the heart of the program. The dismissal of these crucial elements further reduces the already minimal opportunities provided to MDes students at the GSD.

Though your recent email claimed that your decision was the result of “on-going conversations with students, faculty, alumni, and design professionals,” a significant number of students and alumni—including the 376 signatories of this letter, representing each concentration and class from 2012 to 2025—have expressed their astonishment and dismay about these changes, and many have pointed out that the people most affected were not included in key conversations. A number of MDes faculty have also disclosed that they were excluded from the restructuring process and that they were notified only a week before your school-wide announcement. The poor timing of these changes—amidst a pandemic, an economic recession, and a national election—has resulted in undue stress for us all: for students who are already struggling to cope with distance learning, for alumni who are facing the worst job market in a century, and undoubtedly for faculty members who have seen their positions as Area Heads disappear overnight. This has been deeply detrimental to our trust in your leadership.
