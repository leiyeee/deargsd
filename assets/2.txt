We demand that the administration:

1. Reconsider the decision to replace our concentrations with these four ill-conceived domains, or, at the very least, combine the concentrations through a more transparent process and in a more progressive way that does not default to the traditional categories of the design profession and that does not name leading faculty from the landscape, architecture, and planning departments as the new heads.

2. Disclose your process of restructuring MDes, and allow us to review your findings.

3. Actually consult with MDes faculty, students, and alumni. Host discussions and an open forum with students and alumni across concentrations.

4. Enumerate the faculty who are at risk of being demoted or removed due to your decision.

5. Properly credit student work from the original eight concentrations with area names when using them as promotional materials. (For example, student work featured on the new “Narrative” page on the GSD website does not specify the student’s concentration, and this is misleading).
